The decor is so minimalistic and precious. Customer service is 100%.  Don't pass up this cute little joint. (Perfect for studying btw, there was a decent amount of locals on laptops when I visited on a Saturday evening)",

        "My main purpose though was to get some work done so although the latte was amazing as many people agree, I have to give this place 4 stars based on the setup of the place. Most individuals like myself go here to sit, do work, and be high on caffeine, however, the seating is not ergonomic at all! I tired all the different variations of seating just to realize my back would ache on all of them and when I just settled on one, after 20 mins, I was already feeling pain so ended up standing and working",

Plenty of outlets along the walls inside if you want to study! Coffee/food: got the latte and iced hortata andboth we DELICIOUS. I don't know what beans hey use from where, but the quality is amazing. Super friendly and knowledgeable baristas who are great at their jobs!",

I ordered the chocolate latte and it was pretty good. My friend ordered an iced vanilla latte she rates 8.5/10. Service: Baristas were very nice and helpful.",

They've a garden and lots of space outside to hang out and grab some rays while imbibing your favorite beverage or a cup of java.  Definitely a destination location that's eclectic.  Oh, and there are a bunch of pretty awesome food trucks outside if you're clamoring for sustenance that's not liquid.",

Additional taco truck. Cafe: clean, woody feel. Baristi: very good! Notes: Lighting is terrible for working after sundown.  Parking is tough, as it's so popular, and you have to be careful not to park in the permit-only street parking areas.",
