The decor is so minimalistic and precious. Customer service is 100%.  Don't pass up this cute little joint. (Perfect for studying btw, there was a decent amount of locals on laptops when I visited on a Saturday evening)",

        "My main purpose though was to get some work done so although the latte was amazing as many people agree, I have to give this place 4 stars based on the setup of the place. Most individuals like myself go here to sit, do work, and be high on caffeine, however, the seating is not ergonomic at all! I tired all the different variations of seating just to realize my back would ache on all of them and when I just settled on one, after 20 mins, I was already feeling pain so ended up standing and working",
